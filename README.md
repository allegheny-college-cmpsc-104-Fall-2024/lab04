## Introduction
Welcome to the technical writing lab assignment focused on creating a comprehensive user manual for JIRA, the renowned project management and issue tracking software by Atlassian. This assignment is designed to enhance your technical writing skills by applying them to a real-world software tool widely used in the industry.

### Objective
The primary goal of this assignment is to develop a user manual that clearly and accurately describes the functionalities of JIRA, catering to both new and experienced users. You will delve into various aspects of the software, including project setup, issue tracking, workflow customization, and the use of JIRA for agile methodologies.

### Importance of the Assignment
This project will allow you to practice and showcase your ability to translate complex software operations into clear, actionable instructions for end-users. 

### What You Will Learn
